# filepicker_windows

File picker for Windows, using the common item dialog.

You'll find a Flutter example in the `example\flutter` folder, and some Dart
examples in the `example\dart` folder.

At present, Windows support is in preview. To use this package, ensure you are
using the `dev` or `master` channel of Flutter and enable Windows support with:

```bash
flutter channel dev
flutter upgrade
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
```
